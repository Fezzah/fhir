QA Steps:

Automated
* Ensure the build runs successfully with no warnings
** All examples & fragments are schema-valid and schematron valid
** All resource definitions and profiles are valid against their schemas & schematrons + additional rules
** All links resolve in the HTML
** All coded datatypes have bindings
** Fixed values only exist for simple types
** All OCL constraints compile
** Definitions, etc. only end with periods when they ought to
** UML views of everything (including data types) agrees with definitions
** sid values are legal.  All non-sid/guid/oid ids are flagged as warnings unless part of a pre-defined example space

Manual
(Some of these can be focused only on those resources & sections that have changed from prior release)
* Test that the xpath assertions for Schematrons are valid using Saxon SA
* Ensure all content that's supposed to make it into the book form actually does
* Ensure all content from the website that doesn't appear in the book form appears in a secondary form for review
* Place both forms into MS Word and run grammar & spelling checks (U.S. English)
* Ensure all definitions for code sets are mutually exclusive (and comprehensive)
* Ensure definitions are non-tautological and clear
* Ensure definition, rationale & notes are properly split
* Ensure definitions include examples when appropriate
* Ensure statuses on resources & profiles are accurate for ballot
* Ensure text is clear and reads well, with references to other topics when appropriate
* Ensure style guide is followed for use of formatting
* Ensure that constraints (cardinality, vocabulary, invariants, etc.) do not constrain extensibility more than necessary to allow safe base interoperability
