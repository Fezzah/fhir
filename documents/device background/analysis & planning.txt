There's going to be 3 resources

Device Capabilities
 - defines what a device can do
Device Transmission
 - provides data with references to a device capabilities
Device Observation
 - a denormalised sum


There are 4 device related resources
* [[Device]] - an administrative resource that tracks individual devices and their location. Primarily used for attribution of actions to devices
* [[Device Capabilities]] - Defines what observations a device will make when you connect to it directly
* [[Device Emission]] - A raw report from a device at a point in time. Must be paired with the correct Device Capabilities resource in order to be processed
* [[Device Observation]] - A report of observations from a device

The device capabilities and emission resources are used when communicating directly with a device. When a channel is opened with the device, it first sends the Capabilities resource, and then a series of emission resources. The JSON format is used in this case. The application that receives the emission resources may choose to merge the emission with the capabilities statement to create a evice observation, which is suitable for wider use within a EHR/Clinical record context.
