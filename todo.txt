TODO:
- write use cases for reliable messaging 
- when to use profiles   (draft something to go on the wiki in methodology)
- Getting feeds with just summary information (select specific fields to return) (Eliot to protoype something)
- Chained searches over version-specific links, while the search only supports searching on current versions
- pathed search
    /problem?patient.id=[id]
    /patient/@[id]/problem
- redo security event
- revisit PHR scenario
- images - change generation
- add profile to resource? / profileId in resource & the meaning of a profile
- the Zed resource (or the resource with no name)

* Fix problem with schematron paths capturing resources and datatypes used in extensions (by looking for valuexxx)?

Tooling
 - nested extns
 - extensions in profiles
 - Decide what our policy is on including formatting in Excel columns (e.g. italics in formal constraints).


* Profile related changes in tooling:
 1. For profiles, add an additional tab listing resources.  For each resource, include the information from Profile.resource including Profile.resource.closed
 2. Map Intro to Profile.description and Notes to Resource.description.  Both should always refer to file locations to allow content to be HTML.  Determine if this can be determined by naming convention or if we need to reference the filenames in the spreadsheet
 3. For profiles, stop exposing the "Must understand" column for resources and expose "Must support" instead
 4. Ensure the tabs that list codes for bindings include columns for system and display
 5. Update the spreadsheets to reflect all the various changes we've made to Profile.
 6. Add a tab that provides a mapping between the labels on the various tabs and the Profile element names those cells correspond to
* length limits on system artifacts
