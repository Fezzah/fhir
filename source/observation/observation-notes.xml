Notes:

  <ul>
    <li>At its simplest, these resource instances can consist of only a type and a value.  The relevance of other properties will vary based
on the type of observation.  Normal range may be useful for systolic blood pressure, but has little relevance for something like "pregnancy status"</li>
    <li>Profiles may be created to provide guidance on capturing certain types of simple observations.  This resource focuses on the level of detail
captured by most systems.  However, any "simple" observation can easily be broken into numerous components and sub-components to provide additional
information relevant in certain circumstances.  As with other resources, extensions can be used to introduce this additional complexity.</li>
