Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Any person can represent the same organisation in multiple different ways. This may be represented as a single agent resource with multiple role codes, or multiple agent resources. Which is correct depends on whether the combined roles share other attributes, such as identifiers and time periods.</li>
<li>The person and organization references are mandatory, so must be a full resource reference by identifier</li>
</ul>


<h2>
Searching Criteria
</h2>
<p>
The following simple search/filter parameters are defined for person:
</p>
<table class="list">
  <tr><td>person      </td><td>The identity of a person</td></tr>
  <tr><td>organization</td><td>The identity of an organization</td></tr>
  <tr><td>id         </td><td>search id in any agent identifiers</td></tr>
</table>

The standard search parameters also apply (see <a href="http.htm#search">Searching</a>).
