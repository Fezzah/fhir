<h1>FHIR Security</h1>

<p>
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is not a security profile, nor does it define any security
related functionality. However FHIR does define exchange protocols and content models that need to be used
with various security protocols defined elsewhere. This section gathers all information about security
in one section. A summary:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
 <li>TLS - all exchange of production data should be secured using TLS/SSL (i.e. https)</li>
 <li>Authentication - OAuth is recommended. However authentication is done, there needs to be mapping between security protocol identification and device, person and organisation resources. This is discussed below</li>
 <li>Access Control - FHIR does not (presently) address any aspect of access control</li>
 <li>Audit - FHIR defines a <a href="provenance.htm">provenance</a> resource and a <a href="securityevent.htm">security event</a> resource suitable for tracking the history and status of resources</li>
 <li>Digital Signatures - FHIR includes several specifically reserved locations for digital signatures. See below for further information</li>
 <li>Attachments - FHIR allows for attachments. These have their own concerns. See below for discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>
Time critical concerns regarding security flaws in the FHIR specification should be addressed to 
the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_email_list_subscription_instructions">FHIR email 
list</a> for prompt consideration. Alternatively, issues can be raised through the 
<a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Security_Page">community input</a> mechanism.

<h2>
Mapping between resources and security systems
</h2>
<p>
Correctly identifying people, devices, locations and organisations is one of the foundations that any security system is built on. 
Most uses of security protocols, whether authentication, access control, digital signatures etc rely on the correct mapping between
the relevant resources and the underlying systems. Note that this isn't necessary: there is nothing in FHIR that requires or relies 
on any security being in place, or any particular implementation. But real world usage will generally require this.
