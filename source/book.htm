<h2>Ballot Notes for FHIR Draft for Comment ballot</h2>
<p>
Welcome to the FHIR Draft for comment ballot + Connectathon Source. This 
is the "book form" of FHIR, with all the contents in a single stream with 
section numbers. The section numbers are used when making ballot comments.
You can can download this book form and compare previous versions of FHIR
at the FHIR home page (<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>). 
</p>
<p>
This ballot is restricted to the infrastructural parts. Specifically, this 
is the "Introduction" and "Implementation" sections.
Comments may be made against the Resources but there is no guarantee 
that they will ever be acted on.
</p>
<p>
As draft for comment, there are still several open issues around the 
the FHIR specification. 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Should resource.id and resource.profileId be in the instance or in the metadata?</li>
 <li>How should the document content be assembled</li>
 <li>What forms of XML character encoding should be allowed?</li>
 <li>Additional Implementation resources are under development, but not available yet</li>
 <li>The hData intregration page needs to be developed yet</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is expected that these will be resolved between
this ballot and the next, particularly through feedback from the connectathon. 
</p>
<p>
FHIR is a very implementation focused specification. Ballot comments representing real world experience will attract a greater weight; reference the implementation context in your comments where possible.
