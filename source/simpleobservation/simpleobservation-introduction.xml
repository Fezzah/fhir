<p>Observations are a central element in healthcare.  They are used to diagnose, monitor progress, determine baselines and patterns 
and even capture demographic characteristics.  There are several resources such as <a href="labreport.htm">LabReport</a> to capture
complex observations.  However, most observations are simple name-value-pair assertions with little complexity.  This is the resource to
use for such use-cases.  Possibilities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal characteristics: height, weight, eye-color</li>
  <li>Vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, respiration rate</li>
  <li>Diagnoses (Note: trackable conditions, allergies, adverse reactions and more complex structures are handled elsewhere)</li>
  <li>Social history: tobacco use, family supports, cognitive status</li>
  <li>Core characteristics: pregnancy status, death assertion</li>
  <li>Simple scores: APGAR</li>
</ul>
