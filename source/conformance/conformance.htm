<ul>
<li>The MessageConformance resource is a special case; it is only defined for the conformance framework, and is not encountered in other contexts</li>
<li>The interpretation of request and resource depends on the mode. If the mode is sender, then request specifies what the application sends, and response specifies what it accepts. If the mode is "listener", then this is reversed</li>
<li>If a request or response is not specified for an event, then no rules are made for it</li>
<li>Events that are not listed are not supported</li>
</ul>
