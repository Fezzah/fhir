<h1>Common Scenarios in FHIR</h1>

<p>
FHIR is a framework standard that defines a common way to solve healthcare problems, 
and provides a common set of resources that can be used in many different ways. 
This page describes how common usage scenarios are implemented using the capabilities that 
FHIR defines.

<h2>Personal Health Record (PHR)</h2>
<p>
In the PHR scenario, an Electronic Medical Record system (EMR, though many other names and acronyms 
are also used) provides a RESTful API that allows patients to access their own medical
record using some common web portal or mobile application. In this scenario, the 
PHR provider:
</p> 
<ul>
 <li>Provides the patient with a login that identifies them (or links the patient record to an external identity provided by openID, facebook, google etc)</li>
 <li>Authenticates the client using the appropriate OAuth server, and restricts the client to viewing records associated with the specific patient</li>
 <li>The EMR exposes a FHIR server with the following capabilities: 
   <ol>
    <li>read on the <a href="patient.htm">patient</a> resource in order to provide demographics to the client (?? the patient record id is "self")</li>
    <li>search and read on the <a href="documentreference.htm">Document Reference</a> resource to provide access to general patient documents in the form of PDFs</li>
    <li>search and read on a set of clinical resources potentially including Observation, DiagnosticReport, various Medication resources, AdverseReaction/AllergyIntolerance, 
    CarePlan, and Problem</li> 
   </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The PHR may also choose to provide additional functionality, such as shared access to patient 
records by relatives/carers, or to allow the patient to upload their own documents, medication statements, observations
(e.g. from patient monitoring devices), or to allow the patient to make appointments. These 
additional functionalities will involve additional API capabilities to be implemented and 
exposed. The EMR server may also choose to expose the read, search and updates operation on 
the Security Event resource for the patient specific record.
