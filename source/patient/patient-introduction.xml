Note: while the <i>content</i> of the current Patient resource is not yet under ballot, 
the Patient Administration workgroup would like to draw your opinions about the intended 
rename of "Patient" to "SubjectOfCare". This input will be taken into account when
preparing the May 2013 ballot, which will contain a Patient/SubjectOfCare prepared by the
Work Group
</p>
<p>
The decision to change the "Patient" resource name to "SubjectOfCare" was made to be inclusive
of health-related care events where the focus was not on curative activities within the Patient 
Administration scope of work. This would include examples in care such as within social services 
as well as pregnancies, wherein mothers-to-be do not consider themselves "patients" to be cured 
of any illness.
