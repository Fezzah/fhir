<ul>
<li>Document profile names are not used elsewhere in this specification - they are for human consumption</li>
<li>For each document profile, multiple resources will need to be profiled. The document resource must always come first</li>
<li>Ideally, the criteria in different document profile should be able to distinguish between multiple document profiles, so that there is no ambiguity concerning which profile any given document conforms to. However this is not always possible</li>
</ul>
