Notes:

<ul>
<li>The content of the value set is a union of all the import and include statements, and then with any excluded codes eliminated</li>
<li>A value set needs to do something - either to include some codes, or import another value set and exclude some codes</li>
<li>The point of declaring that this value set restricts another is that this value set can then replace the other in a profile 
without changing the meaning. Declaring this explicitly allows profile tools to reason about the relationship without having 
to compute the relationship, which may not be possible for a profile tool</li>
<li>the <i>identifier</i> and <i>version</i> elements may be used to reference this value set in a design, a profile, a 
 CDA template, or V3 message (valueSet and valueSetVersion). These different contexts may make additional restrictions 
 on the possible values of these elements</li>
</ul>
