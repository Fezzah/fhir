<p>A value set specifies a set of codes that may be drawn from one or more 
code systems. Value sets don't actually define the code themselves - they 
just define what codes are included or excluded from the set. Value sets are
defined to control what codes or concepts can be used in a particular context.
</p>

<p>
A value set resource can be automatically converted into a CTS2 value set definition
in order to use a CTS2 server to provide value set functionality
