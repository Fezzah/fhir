<h1>Resources</h1>

<p>
The FHIR specification presently defines the following resources:
</p>
<map id="resmap2" name="resmap2">
<!-- Todo -->
</map>            
<p align="left">
 <!-- 997 * 1743 -->
<img id="resmap1" src="res-map.png" usemap="#resmap2" border="0" height="322" width="562" alt="Resources Concept Map"/>
</p>

<p>
Of these, only the <i>Infrastructure</i> resources have undergone any degree of vetting.  The remaining administrative and clinical resources
exist to provide a sense of what such resources will look like eventually.  Over the coming months, the number of resources and the number of
those that have been vetted by HL7 committees will grow.  A list of hypothesized list of resources can be found on the 
<a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR_Resource_Types">HL7 wiki</a>.  Feel free to add any you feel are missing or engage with one 
of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/index.cfm">HL7 Work Groups</a> to submit a 
<a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Category:FHIR_Resource_Proposal">proposal</a> to define a resource of particular interest.
