  <p>Allergy/Intolerance resources are used to provide information about adverse sensitivities to substances.  An adverse sensitivity is defined as:
    A condition expected to result in undesirable physiologic reaction to an amount of a substance that would not produce a reaction in most individuals.  
  </p>  
  <p>
    Most of the details of the sensitivity can be found in the set of <a href="adversereaction.htm">reactions</a> that are associated with the resource.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="adversereaction.htm">Adverse Reactions</a> do not have to be always associated with an AllergyIntolerance.
    This would usually be done when an individual reaction has not provided enough evidence for an Allergy/Intolerance.
