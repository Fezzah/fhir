<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
This specification describes a set of base resources that are used in many different
contexts in healthcare. In order to make this manageable, applications and specifications need to be
able to:
</p>
<ul class="dense">
 <li>Explain how a set of resources is used in a particular context</li>
 <li>Describe restrictions on the use of the elements defined as part of the resource(s)</li> 
 <li>Define the extensions that are used with the resources</li>
 <li>Describe how resources are bound to terminology in a particular context</li>
</ul>
<p>
All these things are done by a Resource Profile, which is itself a resource that 
describes the usage of one or more other resources. Profiles have a 
metadata section that describes who published the profile, and why, as well as optional
lists of resources constraints, extension definitions, and vocabulary bindings. 
</p>

<h2>Slicing</h2>
<p>
One common operation in a resource profile is to take an element that may occur more
than once, and describe a series of different constraints on the elements in the list. 
In this way, the list is split into a series of individual elements or sub-lists. 
In FHIR, this operation is known as "Slicing" a collection. Here is an example to illustrate the 
process:
</p>

<p>
In this example, the resource definition defines the "relationship" element which may occur
multiple times. The profile for Acme, Inc. constrains the relationship element into 3 different named kinds: 
1 or 2 parents, up to 6 children, and maybe a guardian. No other relationships are supported
by the Acme system. 
</p>
<p>
Note that in FHIR, only the resource is ever actually exchanged. The profile describes a way of 
using the resource, but the item profile names ("parent", etc. in this list) are never exchanged.
The slicing description is more useful if it is "unambiguous": if systems are able to determine which 
relationships in the relationship list that is actually exchanged are parent, child, or 
guardian; in this particular case, the determination is allowed by fixing the value of the 
relationship type element. Fixing a code value is the most common way to slice a list.
