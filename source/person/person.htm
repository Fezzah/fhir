Notes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There are various types of people of interest - patients, employees, etc. Different types of people might come from different service end points.</li>
<li>The administrative gender of the patient is that one that matters for the record. This may match the gendor of birth or the current socially-reported gender.</li>
<li>Qualifications covers both formal education gained in the past, and ongoing certification and accreditation often associated with healthcare providers.</li>
<li>Various jurisdictions define their own qualification and/or codes, and some care about this more than others.</li>
<li>The organization references are all optional, so can be replaced by simple text rather than a full resource reference</li>
<li>A related person can be either reference to another resource using the id, or can provide what is known about the person directly</li>
</ul>
