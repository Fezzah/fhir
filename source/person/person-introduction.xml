Ballot note: The Person resource does justice to Person registries that keep track of Persons regardless 
of their role. The Person resource is also a primary resource to point to for people acting in a particular role
such as SubjectofCare (formerly Patient), Provider, and Agent. Very few attributes are specific to any role and
so Person is kept lean. Most attributes are expected to be tied to the role the Person plays rather than the 
Person himself. Examples of that are Guardian (SubjectofCare), ContactParty (SubjectOfCare, Provider), 
and multipleBirthInd (SubjectofCare).
