This is a draft for what an ATNA Audit Record might look like if provided as a set of FHIR resources. 
This is work in progress performed collaboratively between HL7 and IHE for the MHD/mHealth initiatives. 
Neither HL7 nor IHE is committed to pursuing this path - it is simply being evaluated as a possibility.

<p>
Things to note about the current design:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>in FHIR, Participant Object Detail is handled as extensions</li>
</ul>
