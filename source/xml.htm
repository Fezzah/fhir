<h1>Resource Format</h1>

<p>
In this specification, resources are described in a simple
XML format. This page documents how the content of the resources is described
and controlled. When represented as XML, resources may be validated by schema and schemas are provided, but 
operational systems are not required to do so (though the XML must always be 
valid against this specification). In addition to the simple XML description, W3C 
Schema, UML models, and other definitional models are provided that may be a 
useful aid for system implementation. Resources may also be represented using
<a href="json.htm">JSON</a>.
</p>

<h2>XML Content Models</h2>
<p>
To provide a visual sense of what the end resource instances will look like, all
resources include documentation of their allowed content in a pseudo-XML syntax
that uses the following notation:
</p>
<pre class="spec">
 &lt;<b>name</b> xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir" [xml:lang]&gt; 
   &lt;<u><b title="Formal Definition (must tbe supported or understood)">nameA</b></u>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font><font color="brown">1..1</font> <font color="Darkgreen">type</font> <font color="Navy">description of content</font> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;nameA&gt;
   &lt;<b title="Formal Definition">nameB</b> <font color="red">d?</font>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font><font color="deeppink" title="Condition">0..1</font> <font color="darkgreen">type</font> <font color="Navy">description</font> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;/nameB&gt;
   &lt;<b>nameC</b>&gt; <font color="Brown"><font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font> <b>1..*</b> --&gt;</font>
     &lt;<b>nameD</b>  <font color="red">d?</font>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- </font><font color="brown">1..1</font> <font color="darkgreen">type</font>&gt;<font color="navy">Relevant records</font> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;/nameD&gt;
   &lt;/nameC&gt;
 &lt;name&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The XML character set is always unicode. Specifying the character encoding is optional but recommended. Any encoding that is round trip compatible with unicode is allowed.</li>
 <li>FHIR elements are always in the namespace <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir">http://hl7.org/fhir</a>.  This is usually specified as the default namespace on the root element. The only other namespaces that occur in FHIR resources are where some external content model is introduced into the resource content model. XHTML is found in every resource - see below.</li>
 <li>To build a valid resource, simply replace the contents of the elements with valid content as described by the cardinality, type rules and content description found in the comment in each element.</li>
 <li>Elements are assigned a cardinality that specifies how many times the element may or must appear. If the cardinality is shown in 
    <font color="deeppink">Pink</font> then there is an additional condition that impacts on the allowed cardinality. This is available as a mouse-over text, or in the formal definitions.</li>
 <li>Some elements are marked with a <font color="red">d?</font>, which indicates that they are able to carry the "<i>dataAbsentReason</i>" attribute. <a href="#dataAbsentReason">See below for further discussion</a>.</li>
 <li>The elements are assigned one or more types. All of the types are defined in <a href="datatypes.htm">the data types</a> except for "Resource" and "Narrative" that are documented below. The type names are hyperlinked.</li>
 <li>In the Resource definitions, each element name is also a hyperlink to the formal definition of the element in the data dictionary that underlies the exchange formats. 
   If the element name is underlined, then applications are required to support and/or understand it.</li>
 <li>Any of the XML elements may have an id attribute to serve as <a href="#idref">the target of an internal reference</a>. The id attribute is not shown.</li>
 <li>The root element of a resource may have an xml:lang that specifies the primary language of the resource.</li>
 <li>In addition to this descriptive syntax, other definitional forms are available, including W3C schema, Schematron. The formats Relax NG schema, RDF and eCore are planned.</li>
</ul>
<a name="metadata"></a>
<h2>Resource Data and Metadata items</h2>
<p>
All resources contain with extensions and then a narrative section at the end:
</p>
<pre class="spec">
&lt;<a href="#ResourceDefn" title="A Resource Definition for FHIR" class="dict"><b>[Name]</b></a> xmlns="http://hl7.org/fhir"&gt;
 <font color="Gray">&lt;!-- Defined Content for Resource --&gt;</font>
 &lt;<a href="extensibility.htm" title="See Extensions" class="dict"><b>extension</b></a>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!-- <font color="brown"><b>0..*</b></font> </font> <font color="darkgreen"><a href="extensibility.htm">Extension</a></font>   <a href="extensibility.htm"><font color="navy">See Extensions</font></a> <font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;/extension&gt;
 &lt;<a href="#Narrative" title="Text summary of resource, for human interpretation" class="dict"><b>text</b></a>&gt;<font color="Gray">&lt;!--</font> <font color="brown"><b>1..1</b></font> <font color="darkgreen"><a href="Narrative.htm#Narrative">Narrative</a></font> <font color="navy">Text summary of [x], for human interpretation</font><font color="Gray"> --&gt;</font>&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;/[Name]&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The use of the <i>extensions</i> element is <a href="extensibility.htm">discussed under "Extensibility"</a>. 
The text ("Narrative") is <a href="#Narrative">discussed below</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to these data elements, there are several pieces of metadata about a resource that are not part of the resource
content, but are delegated to the infrastructure:
</p>
<table class="grid">
  <tr><th>Metadata Item</th><th>Type</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Logical Id</td> <td><a href="datatypes.htm#id">id</a></td> <td>The identity of the resource. 
    Resources always have a known identity except in the case where a new resource is being submitted to a server to assign a resource to it. The use of the id element is <a href="#Resource">discussed further below</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Version Id</td><td><a href="datatypes.htm#id">id</a></td><td>Changed each time the content of the resource changes. Can be referenced in a resource reference (see below). Can be used to ensure that updates are based on the latest version of the resource.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Last Modified Date</td><td><a href="datatypes.htm#dateTime">dateTime</a></td><td>Changed each time the content of the resource changes. Can be used by a system or a human to judge the currency of the resource content.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In any environment where the resources are used, the technical details of how these metadata elements are represents will need to be resolved. For further details, 
see <a href="implementation.htm">Implementation Details</a>, which also contains a discussion of how resource identity is maintained.
</p>
<p>
The logical id and version id of a Resource are of type <a href="datatypes.htm#id">id</a> which is up to 36 characters long and contains:
</p>
<table class="list">
  <tr><td>A whole number in the range 0 to 2^64-1. May be represented in hex</td></tr>
  <tr><td>A uuid (guid) (in lowercase, without wrapping with the characters "{}[]" which sometimes occur)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_identifier">ISO OID</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Any other combination of letters, numerals, "-" and "."</td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Resource ids are case sensitive. Ids are always opaque, and systems need not and should not attempt to determine 
their internal structure. However the id is represented, it must always be represented in the same way in resource references and URLs.
</p>


<a name="dataAbsentReason"></a>
<h2>dataAbsentReason</h2>
<p>
Data Quality - or the lack thereof - is a ubiquitious issue in healthcare. In order to handle this, 
many elements defined as part of a resource may have a dataAbsentReason attribute.  This attribute may be used 
to specify why the normally expected content of the data element is missing. 
</p>
<p>
<pre class="xml">
 &lt;<b>[name]</b> dataAbsentReason=""/&gt;
</pre> 
</p>
<p>
 The <i>dataAbsentReason</i> attribute can have one of the following values:
</p>
<table class="codes">
 <tr><td>unknown             </td><td>The value is not known</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;asked   </td><td>The source human does not know the value</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;temp    </td><td>There is reason to expect (from the workflow) that the value may become known</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;notasked</td><td>The workflow didn't lead to this value being known</td></tr>
 <tr><td>masked              </td><td>The information is not available due to security, privacy or related reasons</td></tr>
 <tr><td>unsupported         </td><td>The source system wasn't capable of supporting this element</td></tr>
 <tr><td>astext              </td><td>The content of the data is represented as text (see below)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>error               </td><td>Some system or workflow process error means that the information is not available</td></tr>
</table>
<p> 
Notes: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Using "masked" may be a breach of security or confidentiality. However, there are times when its use
   is required to support alternate workflows for gaining access to denied information.</li>
<li>If the <i>dataAbsentReason</i> attribute is present, the element may still have additional content from its normally
  defined content. Usually this is where the contained elements define what data is missing 
  (for instance, that a <a href="datatypes.htm#Contact">home phone number</a> is unknown).</li>
<li>Systems are not required to process any provided data when a <i>dataAbsentReason</i> is present, but may choose to do so.</li>   
<li>The <i>dataAbsentReason</i> attribute is never used inside the data types, nor can it be used in the <i>text</i> portion 
  of a resource, nor inside an <i>extension</i> block (with the exception of the <i>value</i> of the extension)</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<img src="base.png"/>
<a name="Narrative"></a>
<h2>Narrative</h2>
<p>
Every resource SHALL include a human readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, 
and may be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need 
not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make 
it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resources may define 
what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
</p>
<p>
The narrative for a resource is allowed to contain additional information that is not in 
the structured data, including human-edited content. Such additional information must be 
in the scope of the definition of the resource. In small, closed trading partner environments,
there may be no need for a narrative text. In such cases, implementations are allowed to 
populate the narrative with text equivalent to "No human readable text provided for this resource" (other languages are allowed). 
Implementers should note that small, closed traing partner environments are very likely 
to open up during the lifetime of the resources they define.
</p>
<p>
The narrative is an xhtml fragment that also includes images if appropriate:
</p>
<%dt Narrative%>

<p>
The contents of the <i>div</i> element are an XHTML fragment containing only the basic html formatting elements described in 
chapters 7-11 (except section 4 of chapter 9) and 15 of the HTML 4.0 standard, &lt;a&gt; elements (either name or href),
images and internally contained style attributes. The XHTML content must not contain
a head, a body element, external stylesheet references, scripts, forms, base/link/xlink, frames, iframes,
and objects. 
<!-- Todo: Formally encode these constraints in schematron -->
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;narrative&gt;
    &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;This is a simple 
          example with only plain text&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/narrative&gt;
   
  &lt;narrative&gt;
   &lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;
       This is an &lt;i&gt;example&lt;/i&gt; with some &lt;b&gt;xhtml&lt;/b&gt; formatting.
     &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;narrative&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The image source may be a local reference within the resource:
</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;img src="#a5"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This is a <a href="#idref">internal reference</a> to an id attribute on an element in the same resource, either in the image attachments on the text element 
directly, or an element of type "<a href="datatypes.htm#Attachment">Attachment</a>".
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;narrative&gt;
    &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;#a1/&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;image id=&quot;a1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;mimeType&gt;image/png&lt;/mimeType&gt;
      &lt;data&gt;MEKH....SD/Z&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/image&gt;
  &lt;narrative&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since the presence of images that are not part of the resource is not guaranteed, 
images that are an essential part of the narrative should always be embedded.
</p>
<p>
The <i>dataAbsentReason</i> is not used on the narrative element or any elements 
contained in it. The xhtml element must have some non-whitespace content.
</p>
<p>
Note: the XHTML is contained in general XML, and there is no support for HTML entities
like <i>&amp;nbsp;</i> or <i>&amp;copy;</i> etc. Unicode characters should be used instead. Note that 
<i>&amp;#160;</i> substitutes for <i>&amp;nbsp;</i>.
</p>

<a name="css"></a>
<h3>Styling the XHTML</h3>
<p>
The XHTML fragment in the narrative may be styled using CSS in the normal fashion, using a mix of classes, ids 
and in-line style elements. Specific CSS stylesheets will be applied to the XHTML when it is extracted from
the resource to be displayed to a human to create the presentation desired in the context of use. Authors
may fix the following styling aspects of the content:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>bold, italic, underline, strikethrough</li>
  <li>font color, family, and size</li>
  <li>background colour, text alignment</li>
  <li>whitespace interpretation</li>
  <li>ordered list number format (since it may be referred to in text)</li>
</ul>
<p>
These style properties are specified in-line using the style attribute. If an equivalent 
html element exists, such as "i", or "pre", it may be used instead, but note that some of these 
elements are deprecated in HTML 4 and must not be used in Narrative XHTML (including "u", and "font").
</p>
<p>
Rendering systems are required to respect any of these rendering styles when they are specified in 
the XHTML, though appropriate interpretation is allowed (e.g. a low-contrast display for dark 
room contexts may adjust colors accordingly). 
</p>
<p>
Authors are allowed to specify additional styles and style properties as specified in the CSS specification,
but these are extensions to this specification and renderers are not required to honor them. Note, however,
the additional rules around styling that apply in the context of <a href="documentheader.htm#css">documents</a>.
</p>
<a name="idref"></a>
<h2>Internal References</h2>
<p>
There are 4 cases where elements inside a resource reference each other:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>From <a href="extensibility.htm#Extension">an extension element</a> to its target element</li>
 <li>Inside a <a href="datatypes.htm#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept data type to identify the primary encoding</a></li>
 <li>An &lt;img src=""/&gt; reference in the narrative, referring to an image found in the resource</li>
 <li>Between elements in the narrative and structured data elements</li>
</ul>
<p>
These references are done using an id/idref based approach, where a source element indicates that it 
has the same content as the target element. The target element has an attribute "id" which must 
have a unique value within the resource with regard to any other id attributes. The "id" attribute is not in any namespace.
The source element has no content (text or children elements) and just a single attribute named "idref". The value of 
the idref attribute must match the value of an id attribute in the same resource (or, for a CodeableConcept, inside the
same datatype). 
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;example&gt;
    &lt;target id="a1"&gt;
      &lt;child&gt;content&lt;/child&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
    &lt;-- other stuff --&gt;
    &lt;source idref="a1"&gt;
  &lt;/example&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In a single resource, this works exactly like xml:id/idref, but there is an important difference: the 
uniqueness and resolution scope of these id references is within the resource that contains them. If multiple
resources are combined into a single piece of XML, such as an <a href="atom.htm">atom feed</a>, duplicate 
values may occur between resources. This must be managed by applications reading the resources.
</p>
<p>
Note that all references between the xhtml elements and the data elements must be understood to 
establish a "derived from" relationship, where the derived content (whether text or data) refers 
to the source content.
</p>

<a name="Resource"></a>
<h2>Resource References</h2>
<p>
The "Resource" type indicates a reference from one resource to another.
</p>
<%dt ResourceReference%>
<p>
The reference must specify the resource type, whether or not the type of the resource reference is fixed for the element in the resource definition.
A resource reference may contain either a version independent reference (<i>"id"</i>) or a version dependent reference (<i>"version"</i>)
or both. If both are provided, it is at the descretion of the processor of the data whether to access the version specific of version independent reference. 
</p>
<p>
Both the id and the version are URL references - they must be literal URLs that resolve to the location of the resource.
Both URLs may either be absolute URLs, or relative URLS. If they are relative URLs, they are interpreted to contain the <a href="#metadata">id and versionId</a> 
respectively of the resource in question, and the resolution of the local references is a matter of implementation logic. 
If relative references are used, a <i>version</i> cannot be provided without an <i>id</i>, since the <i>version</i> may be scoped by the <i>id</i>.
Using absolute URLs provides a stable scalable approach suitable for a cloud/web context, while using relative/logical references provides a flexible approach suitable for use
when trading between separated eco-systems. Absolute URLs do not need to point to a <a href="http.htm">FHIR RESTful 
server</a>, though this is the preferred approach. Irrespective of whether the URL points to a FHIR RESTful server or includes the logical id in the URL, 
URLs are always considered to be case-sensitive and lowercase is preferred.
</p>

<div class="example">
<p>A relative reference to the <a href="patient.htm">patient</a> "034AB16" in an element named "context":</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;context&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;Patient&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;034AB16&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;context&gt;
</pre>
<p>An absolute reference to a <a href="profile.htm">resource profile</a> in an element named "profile":</p>
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;profile&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;Profile&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;http://fhir.hl7.org/svc/profile/@c8973a22-2b5b-4e76-9c66-00639c99e61b&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;profile&gt;
</pre>
<p><i>Note that HL7 has not yet actually created a profile registry, nor decided on a URL for it</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>
Plain text narrative may be provided that describes the resource in addition to the resource reference (or in place of, if a 
dataAbsentReason is allowed).
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="xml">
  &lt;id&gt;
    &lt;type&gt;Organisation&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;1234&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;text&gt;HL7, Inc&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="use">
<p><b>Use</b></p>
<p>
Unless the resource reference element has a dataAbsentReason flag, it must contain 
a valid <i>type</i> and (<i>id</i> or <i>version</i>). 
</p>
</div>

<h2>Inter-version Compatibility</h2>
<p>
There is no explicit version marker in the XML. Subsequent versions
of this specification may introduce new elements at any point in the 
content models, but the path and meaning of existing data elements will not be 
changed. Given that, in a typical scenario, mixed versions may need to exist, 
applications SHOULD ignore elements that they do not recognize unless those
elements are marked with a "must understand" attribute. However, in 
a healthcare context, many application vendors are unwilling to 
consider this approach because of concerns about clinical risk. 
Applications are not required to ignore unknown elements, but must
declare whether they will do so in their conformance statements using the
<i>acceptUnknown</i> element.
</p>

<h2>XML Schema and Schematron</h2>
<p>
This specification provides schema definitions for all of the content models described here. 
The base schema is called "<a href="fhir-base.xsd">fhir-base.xsd</a>" and defines all of the 
datatypes and also the base infrastructure types described on this page. In addition, there 
is a schema for each resource and a common schema <a href="fhir-all.xsd">fhir-all.xsd</a>
that includes all the resource schemas.  A customized atom schema <a href="fhir-atom.xsd">fhir-atom.xsd</a>
is provided for validating <a href="atom.htm">bundles</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the w3c schema files, this specification also provides Schematron files that
enforce the various constraints defined for the datatypes and resources.  These are packaged
as files for each resource as well as a combined fhir-atom.sch file
that incorporates the rules for all resources.
</p>
<p>
XML that is exchanged must be valid against the w3c schema and Schematron, though there is no requirement to
validate instances against either, nor is being valid against the schema and Schematron sufficient 
to be a conformant instance. (This specification makes several rules that cannot be checked 
by either mechanism.) Exchanged content must not specify the schema or even the schema instance 
namespace in the resource itself. 
</p>

<!-- Todo: Relax NG, RDF, eCore -->

<a name="objects"></a>
<h2>Object Models</h2>
<p>
In addition to the schema, this specification also provides object
models defined in UML that may be of assistance in defining systems 
that work with the resources defined here.
</p>
<p>
Although the UML models provided express the same contents as the 
resource formats, because of the wide variation in how different architectures and 
tools map from UML to XML, there should be no expectation that any particular
tool will produce compatible XML from these UML diagrams. Systems are welcome
to use these object models as a basis for serialization internally or even
between trading partner systems, with any form of exchange technology (including 
JSON). Systems that use this form of exchange cannot claim to be conformant 
with this specification, but can describe themselves as using "FHIR consistent
object models".
