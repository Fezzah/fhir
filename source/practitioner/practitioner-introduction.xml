Although a Practitioner Resource represents individuals, they may practice their profession on behalf on an organization. Commonly, a Practitioner represent the same organization in multiple different ways. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each combination of role, qualification and organization. The role is also often limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends. Note that the represented organization need not necessarily be the (direct) employer of a Practitioner.
