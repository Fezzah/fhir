<p>
A Questionnaire is a structured set of answers to a predefined list of questions. The Questionnaire can be a flat list, or can be composed
of (possibly named) sections and subsections, each containing answers. There may be multiple answers to the same question and even whole
sections may be repeated. Anwers identify the question they answer and take the form of codes, values, text. They may be shaped like or based 
on Observations, Procedures and other resources.</p>

<p>Questionnaires cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full
clinical speciality records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. Although there is possible overlap between the 
information covered by Questionnaires and other Resources (mainly Observation, Procedure and MedicationAdministration), the process of collection and 
recording differ: Questionnaires record history while Resources are part of the registration of an ongoing clinical process. Because of this overlap,
Questionnaire allows information both to be based on on-screen forms and/or actual Observations and other Resources using Answer.evidence.</p>

<p>Questionnaires differ from Lists because Lists regroup or summarize existing information, while Questionnaires contain original, 
clinician collected data.</p>

<p>Examples of Questionnaires are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Past medical history (PMH)</li>
<li>Family diseases</li>
<li>Social history</li>
<li>Research questionnaires</li>
<li>Quality and evaluation forms</li>
</ul>
