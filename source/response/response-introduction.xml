<p>
The response to request indicates the outcome of processing the request itself - whether it 
was accepted or rejected, or is still in process. The response resource does not itself convey 
or represent information that arises as a result of processing the request, but it may have 
references to other resources that have this information, in order to link between request
and outcome.
</p>
<p>
There may be multiple responses for a given request. For some requests, a responding system
may issue a sequence of responses, where each response replaces previous responses as the original
request is processed. In these cases, each response should have the same logical identity, and 
a different version id. 
</p>
<p>
If there are multiple systems responding to the request, or if there request may have multiple
responses, then different logical responses should carry different logical ids.
