    <p>Representing Medication in the majority of healthcare settings is a matter of idfentifying an item from a list and then conveying the code for the item selected either into 
        the patient record or to other applications.  Additional information is frequently provided for human verification but generally there is no justification for extensive
        modelling of the Medicines domain - most systems cannot use it.  There are some occasions where it is necessary to identify slightly more detail.  For instance dispensing a 
        package containing a particular medicine requires identification both of the medicine and the package in one go.  There are also some occasions where the composition of a 
        medicine must be represented.  Most systems make some attempt at  this even though it is quite rarely used.  In these cases the ingredients of the medicine have to be specified
        together with the amount contained.
    </p>
    <p>The Medication resource meets these challenges by only representing a single layer of information at a time and allowing the parent and child layers of information to be refered
        to a additional instances of the resource.  Thus a Package can have a child that is one or more medicines.  A medicine can have a parent package and one or more child ingredients.  
        An ingredient can have a Medicine as a parent and one or more sub-ingredents as children.  The hierarchy of composition can be defined as required.</p>
