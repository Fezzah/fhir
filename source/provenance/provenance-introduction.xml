<p>
The provenance resource tracks information about the entities, activities, and people involved in producing a resource.
This information can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness, or to provide 
pointers for where to go to further investigate the origins of the resource and the information in it. 
</p>
<p>
The provenance resource is based on known practices in the HL7 implementation space, particularly
those found in the v2 EVN segment, the v3 ControlAct Wrapper, the CDA header, and the IHE ATNA (<a href="http://www.rfc3881.net">RFC 3881</a>).
The conceptual model underlying the design is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/Main_Page">W3C Provenance Specification</a>. Though
the content and format of the resource is designed to meet specific requirements for FHIR, all the parts of the resource are formally mapped to the PROV-O specification,
and FHIR resources can be transformed to their W3C PROV equivalent.
