<!--
Lloyd:
To put it another way, if you're binding to specific vocabularies, you're no longer in the "conceptual' space, you're starting to get into the logical/implementable space.  If your intention is to create a logical/implementable UML model, that's ok, but it's not appropriate to call the model a DAM.  On the other hand, if you're planning to produce a v3 specification, your logical/implementable model is required to be a RIM-based model and thus vocabulary binding should only happen there.

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) defines a set of "resources" for health.
These resources represent granular clinical concepts that can be exchanged in order to 
quickly and effectively solve problems in healthcare and related process. 
The resources cover the basic elements of healthcare - patients, admissions, diagnostic
reports, medications, and problem lists, with their typical participants, and also support
a range of richer and more complex clinical models. 
The simple direct definitions of the resources are based on 
thorough requirements gathering, formal analysis and extensive 
cross-mapping to other relevant standards.
