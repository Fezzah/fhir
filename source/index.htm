<h1>Welcome to FHIR</h1>
<!--
Lloyd:
To put it another way, if you're binding to specific vocabularies, you're no longer in the "conceptual' space, you're starting to get into the logical/implementable space.  If your intention is to create a logical/implementable UML model, that's ok, but it's not appropriate to call the model a DAM.  On the other hand, if you're planning to produce a v3 specification, your logical/implementable model is required to be a RIM-based model and thus vocabulary binding should only happen there.

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) defines a set of "resources" for health.
These resources represent granular clinical concepts that can be exchanged in order to 
quickly and effectively solve problems in healthcare and related processes. 
The resources cover the basic elements of healthcare - patients, admissions, diagnostic
reports, medications and problem lists - with their typical participants and also support
a range of richer and more complex clinical models. 
The simple direct definitions of the resources are based on 
thorough requirements gathering, formal analysis and extensive 
cross-mapping to other relevant standards.

Note: Why not use a standard open source license? We'd like to use <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> or 
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">a license listed here</a>, but none of them actually deliver on 
the plain English intent above in important ways. We aspire to meet <a href="http://opensource.org/osr-intro">these requirements from the Open

While we resolve the questions around the long term license, the following license,
adapted from the <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a> (thanks for allowing this), applies:
</p>

HL7 is and shall at all times be the sole entity that may authorize developers, suppliers and

stated in the FHIR specification. Software developed only partially matching the applicable 
compliance points may claim only that the software was based on FHIR, but may 
not claim compliance or conformance with this specification. In the event that testing suites 
or processes are implemented or approved by HL7, Inc., software developed using this 
specification may claim compliance or conformance with the FHIR specification only if the 
software satisfactorily completes the testing suites.
