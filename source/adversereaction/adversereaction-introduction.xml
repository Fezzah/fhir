  <p>Adverse Reaction resources are used to provide information about specific reactions to a substance.  These are normally associated with an <a href="allergyintolerance.htm">AllergyIntolerance</a> resource,
    but can be reported on their own when no assumption of further reactions is being made.
  </p>  
  <p>If there are multiple reactions to occur due to an exposure to a substance, each of those reactions would be result in
    separate instances of an Adverse Reaction resource.  As an example, if a subject experienced a rash, vomiting, and anaphylaxis,
    those would be three separate AdverseReactions that each had the same Manifestation.occurrenceDate.
