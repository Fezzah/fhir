- need to describe relative references better + xml:base? all references relative to service base? (note searching issue)
- binary resource - change to "contained resource", and add to all resources page, profile
- When doing history for a non-existent resource (!= GONE, really never existed), return 404? Or empty history?
- renaming id fields
- sorting things in schemas
- nested contained resources are to be banned
- media type discussion
- json native number data type instead of string
- when to use profiles
- add a note about the limitation of the signature in Provenance


Search
  - need to fix up the way search parameters for resource references are defined
  - update xpath path to use custom syntax 
  - $include. There is a difference between  Observation/subject,Observation/performer,Device/owner and Observation/subject/owner, Observation/performer - m
  - Chained searches over version-specific links, while the search only supports searching on current versions
  - Getting feeds with just summary information (select specific fields to return)
  - update text : A typical case where this is useful is where the client is querying on the patient resource, but for every patient resource returned, the client will also need the person resource that the patient refers to
 - issues around search and relative urls and links - are they constrained to the same path?


- Batch
  - Handling versions in batches: having multiple versions of entries with the same id.
  - Supporting version-specific ResourceReferences by using cid: on the selflink
  - Supporting version-aware updates by using <link rel='predecessor-version'> in an entry


Tooling
 - nested extensions
 - extensions in profiles
