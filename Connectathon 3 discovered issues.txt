- need to describe relative references better + xml:base? all references relative to service base? (note searching issue)
 - proposal - implementation experience makes it too hard. Make all references relative to the service base, not the local resource

- when to use profiles
  - draft something to go on the wiki in methodology

Search
  - need to fix up the way search parameters for resource references are defined
     - proposal: tuple with syntax to pair in the value (search?statedate=[date]$[state])
     - proposal: subject=Patient(/@23)
  
  - Getting feeds with just summary information (select specific fields to return)
     - Eliot to protoype something 

  - Chained searches over version-specific links, while the search only supports searching on current versions




Wed Q1


- write use cases for reliable messaging 

- add id to conformance
- add note about instance to Device
- reserve space for note about product relating to device vs kind and medication subscribing

DiagnosticOrder
- different codes may have different status (need to recurse - at what point)?
- specimens (wha was collected)
- provider might specify location
- rename Short Name to Short Label in the spreadsheets



Need to add discussion of subject - consistency issue in resource references (NO ASSUMPTIONS CAN BE MADE)


element name
unless element name is meaningless without scope (consider just parent name)
unless duplicate search parameter
[parent]-[child] is default


Add support for v3 relationships with value sets (including null flavors)

	
add profile.identifier like valueset
add scale factor

change documentation around connecting to device - or proxy


Virtual Medical Device: a medical-related subsystem of a medical device. The virtual device that may be part of the containing device, or a separate device that may be communicating with it


Tags:
* a tag is associated with a version (can track history of tags)
* in the atom feeds, tags go on a resource in atom entry
* when a server sends a resource directly, it adds the tags using the category header
* when a client posts or puts a resource, it can use the category header
* when a client requests a tag list for some user, it gets an atom with no entries and just categories
 * [fhir]/tags - get a list of all tags
 * [fhir]/[type]/tags - get a list of all tags for this type
 * [fhir]/[type]/@[id]/tags - get a list of tags for current version
 * [fhir]/[type]/@[id]/history/@[id]/tags - get a list of tags for past version
* tags can be changed on old versions
* a new version of a reosurce keeps all the tags of a previous resource, and gains any new tags associated with the post
* tags must be deleted explicitly
* to add a tag: Post a category (or more) in an atom to [fhir]/[type]/@[id]/tags or [fhir]/[type]/@[id]/history/@[id]/tags
* to delete a tag: delete a category (or more) in an atom to [fhir]/[type]/@[id]/tags or [fhir]/[type]/@[id]/history/@[id]/tags


change provenance to have multiple targets?
what are the relationship of EHR record life cycle event to FHIR?
