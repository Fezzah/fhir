- need to describe relative references better + xml:base? all references relative to service base? (note searching issue)
 - proposal - implementation experience makes it too hard. Make all references relative to the service base, not the local resource

- when to use profiles
  - draft something to go on the wiki in methodology

Search
  - need to fix up the way search parameters for resource references are defined
     - proposal: tuple with syntax to pair in the value (search?statedate=[date]$[state])
     - proposal: subject=Patient(/@23)
  
  - Getting feeds with just summary information (select specific fields to return)
     - Eliot to protoype something 

  - Chained searches over version-specific links, while the search only supports searching on current versions




Wed Q1
- need to document the meaning of IsModifier on each element, including what it means if element is missing (if allowed)
- rename IssueReport to OperationOutcome
- rename message.instance to message.timestamp
- make reliable messaging optional and put it in the conformance profile
- write use cases for reliable messaging 
- update doe 63 (currency vs consequence)
- be consistent with receiver/listener
- drop background header in profile narrative
- add id to conformance
- add note about instance to Device
- reserve space for note about product relating to device vs kind and medication subscribing

DiagnosticOrder
- different codes may have different status (need to recurse - at what point)?
- specimens (wha was collected)
- provider might specify location
- 


Need to add discussion of subject - consistency issue in resource references (NO ASSUMPTIONS CAN BE MADE)


element name
unless element name is meaningless without scope (consider just parent name)
unless duplicate search parameter
[parent]-[child] is default


Add support for v3 relationships with value sets (including null flavors)

Add a note to minimum cardinality explaining the issues

	
add search token on valueset.description
valueset.version - recommend a timestamp
add profile.identifier like valueset
add scale factor

change documentation around connecting to device - or proxy


element name
unless elen
Tooling
 - nested ext tns
 - extensions in profiles
