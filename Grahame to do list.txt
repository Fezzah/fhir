 2. Map Intro to Profile.description and Notes to Resource.description.  Both should always refer to file locations to allow content to be HTML.  Determine if this can be determined by naming convention or if we need to reference the filenames in the spreadsheet
 3. For profiles, stop exposing the "Must understand" column for resources and expose "Must support" instead
 4. Ensure the tabs that list codes for bindings include columns for system and display
 5. Update the spreadsheets to reflect all the various changes we've made to Profile.
