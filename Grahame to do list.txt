- Apply agreed changes to Profile resource (see previous note)
- Fix problem with schematron paths, including:
-- Capturing resources and datatypes used in extensions (by looking for valuexxx)
- Investigate whether we can reliably use timestamps to determine whether the exported graphics images are up-to-date with the XMI source.  If not, maybe add a prompt in the official (non-sandbox) build process to check the images.
- Get constraints rendering in the HTML (presume if it's there, book view follows automatically)
- Spit out a warning if you encounter an unrecognized column name rather than just deprecated names
- Decide what our policy is on including formatting in Excel columns (e.g. italics in formal constraints).
- Figure out what Profile.binding.description is trying to represent and then give it a better name.
- Figure out what we're doing with Profile.resource.element.content on the grounds that referencing constraints by name is bad when we can reference by id, we already have a way to reference constraint by id, constraints are specific to a single context.
