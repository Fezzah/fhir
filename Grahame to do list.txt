- Figure out what Profile.binding.description is trying to represent and then give it a better name.
- Figure out what we're doing with Profile.resource.element.content on the grounds that referencing constraints by name is bad when we can reference by id, we already have a way to reference constraint by id, constraints are specific to a single context.
- Apply agreed changes to Profile resource (see previous note)
- Get constraints rendering in the HTML (presume if it's there, book view follows automatically)
- Figure out how to get the "id" attribute to show up in Narrative.image in the spec
- Fix the Atom XML so it renders using the new format
- Get search working in a pop-up
- Fix problem with schematron paths, including:
-- Capturing resources and datatypes used in extensions (by looking for valuexxx)
- Spit out a warning if you encounter an unrecognized column name rather than just deprecated names
- Document the JSON representation of an atom feed (or at least indicate one is coming)
- Investigate whether we can reliably use timestamps to determine whether the exported graphics images are up-to-date with the XMI source.  If not, maybe add a prompt in the official (non-sandbox) build process to check the images.

- Change the CSS so grid tables stay left-aligned rather than centered.
- Change name of Document to DocumentHeader and message to MessageHeader and the REST interface of 

Post freeze
- Raise issue of whether mailbox needs to support async on the wiki
- Decide what our policy is on including formatting in Excel columns (e.g. italics in formal constraints).
- Import table contents for base simple types in datatypes.htm from Primitives.xml
- Import textual content for complex datatype descriptions (rationale, notes, etc.) from the datatypes source rather than maintaining duplicate copies in datatypes.htm
- Clean up how examples are handled for datatypes
- Clean up how the tables look in terminologies-bindings
- Maintain datatype examples in XML files so we can actually validate them against the schemas and schematrons
- Add schematron validation to the build process
- Play with the CSS so that with the datatype examples the label is closer to the example it describes than the one above it
- Come up with guidelines for:
-- How formatting gets used (bold, italics, hyperlinks, quotes)
-- When do we start with capital letters vs. not
-- When do we end with periods vs. not
-- What should go in short name, definition, rationale & notes
- Have someone go through all the content and enforce the guidelines
- Have someone who's good with web styles look at our pages and think about how we can improve readability and aesthetics through better use of color, background, whitespace, etc.
- Add support for validation of UML views of datatypes against definitions too
- Ensure that where elements get used in multiple paths that the schematron context generators take into account all possible paths
