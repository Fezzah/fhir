/**
 * An identifier that humans use. This is different to a system identifier because identifiers that humans use are regularly changed or retired due to human intervention and error. Note that an human identifier may be a system identifier on some master system, but becomes a human identifier elsewhere due to how it is exchanged between humans. Driver's license nunmbers are a good example of this. Also, because human mediated identifiers are often invoked as implicit links to external business processes, such identifiers are often associated with multiple different resources.
